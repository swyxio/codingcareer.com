            Ever feel like you didn’t have anyone outside work to talk to about
            your career? Here’s a dedicated space where you can do exactly that,
            with like minds who have gone down the same road you have.
            <strong>The Coding Career Community</strong>
            is a moderated Discord chat where you can talk with other readers
            about the ideas from the book, ask questions, give criticism, find
            collaborators, and generally use as a friendly resource as you build
            your coding career.
          </p>

            Note: Participation in the Community is subject to a Code of
            Conduct, and your questions are not guaranteed to be answered.
            <strong>This is a new community</strong>
            and therefore there is a lot left to figure out!
